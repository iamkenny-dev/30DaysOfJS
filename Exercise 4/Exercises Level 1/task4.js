// Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript?
//
// Enter a number: 2
// 2 is an even number
//
// Enter a number: 9
// 9 is is an odd number.

let evenNumber = prompt('Enter a number: ');
if (evenNumber % 2 = 0) {
	console.log('it is divisible by two')
}
else {
	console.log('it is not divisible by two');
}
