// Explain the difference between forEach, map, filter, and reduce.

forEach is used to loop over each element in an array but it does not save a returned value in a new variable.

filter loops over each element and returns the filtered element.

Map loops through array and saves a new array based on existing array using callback function.

reduce reduces an array to a single value by adding them together.
